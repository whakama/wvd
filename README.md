# wine version downloader (wvd)

just a simple script that allows you to download various wine versions from playonlinux's downloader's api without having to use playonlinux itself  
this is old-ish code from early 2023, but i figured id open source it incase someone can make use of it (and its just kinda cool)

assumes you're on a unix like operating system with tar installed, only downloads linux versions of wine
